# cleffy-list
This is my personal list for [Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector). 

Bots will be marked with "Bot" in the description/proof section. Human cheaters will have a blank description/proof.

**I will only mark players who I am 100% confident are cheating as "cheater".**

Players who I think are very likely cheating, but I haven't seen solid enough evidence of this, will be marked as "suspicious". Do not assume these players are cheaters based only on this tag.

I am the only one who manages this list. I will only add cheaters I encounter in-game myself to this list.
