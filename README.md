# cleffy-list
This is my personal playerlist for [Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector). 

Bots are marked with the word "Bot" in the "reason/proof" section. Human cheaters have a blank "reason/proof".

**I only mark a player as "cheater" if I am fully confident they are cheating.** As a result, closet/non-blatant cheaters are mostly left out from this list or possibly marked as "suspicious".

Players marked as "suspicious" I consider highly likely to be cheating but I haven't seen solid enough evidence to mark them as cheater.

I am the only one who manages this list. I only add cheaters/bots I encounter myself to this list. I do not accept submissions from others nor will I merge this list with anyone else's list.

This list is most effective on Stockholm and Frankfurt servers, since that's where I play casual most of the time.
