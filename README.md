# cleffy-list
This is my personal playerlist for [Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/surepy/tf2_bot_detector). 

Bots are marked with the word "Bot" in the "reason/proof" section. Human cheaters have a blank "reason/proof". Cheaters encountered in MvM will be marked with "mvm". 

**I only mark a player as "cheater" if I am fully confident they are cheating.** As a result, closet/non-blatant cheaters are mostly left out from this list or marked as "suspicious".

Players marked as "suspicious" I consider highly likely to be cheating but I haven't seen solid enough evidence to mark them as cheater.

I am the only one who manages this list. I only add cheaters/bots I encounter myself to this list. I do not accept submissions from others nor will I merge this list with anyone else's list.

This list is most effective on Stockholm and Frankfurt servers, since that's where I play casual most of the time.

Remember that even though I'm very careful with who I mark on this list, I am a human and therefore suspectible to human error. Misclicks or other blunders can never be fully ruled out. Don't just blindly trust my list, or anyone else's list for that matter. If you think you are falsely marked on this list, you can contact me and we can discuss it.
