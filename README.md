# cleffy-list
This is my personal list for [Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector). 

Bots will be marked with "Bot" in the description/proof section. Human cheaters will have a blank description/proof.

**I will only mark players who I am 100% confident are cheating as "cheater".** Only players who I myself can see actively cheating will get this mark. 

Players who I think are very likely to be cheaters, but I haven't seen solid evidence of this, will be marked as "suspicious". Do not assume these players are cheaters based on the tag.

PLEASE NOTE: I am personally using the following playerlists:
- [playerlist.trusted](https://github.com/ClusterConsultant/TF2BD-Community-Lists/raw/main/playerlist.trusted.zip)
- [playerlist.nullc0re](https://github.com/surepy/tf2db-sleepy-list/releases)
- [playerlist.sleepy-bots.merged](https://github.com/surepy/tf2db-sleepy-list/releases)
- [playerlist.megacheaterdb](https://github.com/surepy/tf2db-sleepy-list/releases)
- [playerlist.biglist](https://github.com/ClusterConsultant/TF2BD-Community-Lists/raw/main/playerlist.biglist.zip)
- [playerlist.official](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector)

I wont bother adding anyone already within one of these lists to my personal list, so I recommend using these playerlists yourself for optimal results.
