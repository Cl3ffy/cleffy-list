# cleffy-list
This is my personal playerlist for [Team Fortress 2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector). 

Bots will be marked with "Bot" in the description/proof section. Human cheaters will have blank description/proof.

**I will only mark players who I am 100% confident are cheating as cheater.**

Players marked as "suspicious" I consider highly likely to be cheating but I haven't seen solid enough evidence to mark them as cheater. Do not assume these players are cheaters based only on this mark alone. 

I am the only one who manages this list. I will only add cheaters/bots I encounter in-game myself to this list. I do not accept submissions from others.

Remember that you shouldn't blindly trust accusations from a random internet stranger, including me. Use other lists for cross-checking if possible, check their profile and steam history, etc. And most importantly use your own eyes and brain.
